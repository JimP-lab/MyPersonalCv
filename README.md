Personal Cv is a page that shows the credentials of my cv.

Personal Cv was created with html css javascript, prompt engineering And a contact form using formspark.io.

Personal Cv was deployed with GitHub pages with a custom domain in 7 minutes and now the domain currently is used in another project but i manage to do the process in the timeframe of 7 minutes.
